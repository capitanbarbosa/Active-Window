# Active-Window

An always-on-top activity log, linked to my Notion database. Placed inside the unused space of the Windows taskbar.

Helps me keep track of all of activities and keep focus throughout the day.

Made with Python, tkinter, and the Notion-client api.

To use, create a duplicate of this page/database in Notion: https://wizbarbosa.notion.site/b01db901b1404289a2ff50f3b5587979?v=f207c6814b5f4e0383a768e0a82bec2e&pvs=4

Then, get an API key from Notion and insert it along with the Notion page id into the example .env
