To separate this code into MVC components, we need to identify the Model, View, and Controller components.

The Model component should contain the business logic and data access code. In this code, the database access and manipulation functions such as readDatabase, update_database, and show_result should be part of the Model.

The View component should handle the user interface code. In this code, the entire Tkinter code, including the window creation, layout, and widget configuration, should be part of the View.

The Controller component should handle the interaction between the Model and View. In this code, the functions that handle user input, such as createPage, toggle_size, move_lock, and toggle_timer, should be part of the Controller.

Here's a diagram of the method structure for each component:

Model:

readDatabase(databaseId, headers)
update_database()
show_result(index)
View:

window creation and layout
widget configuration
Controller:

createPage(databaseId, headers)
toggle_size()
move_lock()
toggle_timer()
Note that the code will need to be refactored to separate the Model, View, and Controller components properly. The Model and Controller components should not have any direct access to the Tkinter widgets, and the View should not have any business logic or data access code.
